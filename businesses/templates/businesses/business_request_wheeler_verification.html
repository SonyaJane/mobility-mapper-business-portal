  <p>Business: <strong>{{ business.business_name }}</strong></p>
  
  <div>
    <p>By requesting Wheelers to verify your business, you are asking three community members to visit the location, confirm accessibility features, and submit a short accessibility report.</p>    

  {% if business.tier == "premium" %}
    <p>The cost of this request is covered by your premium plan.</p>   
  {% elif business.tier == "standard" %}
    <p>As you are on the standard plan, the cost of this request is half price at ¬£10 per Wheeler.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>As you are on the free plan, the cost of this request is ¬£20 per Wheeler.</p>
  {% endif %}

  <p>Once three Wheelers have verified your business, you will earn a <strong>Verified Accessibility</strong> badge. This badge appears next to your listing in search results, helping customers identify trusted accessible venues at a glance. You can view each verification report and track your verification status at any time from your <a href="{% url 'business_dashboard' %}">Business Dashboard</a>.</p>

  <div class="mb-3">
    <span class="text-success fw-bold" style="font-size:1.25rem;">‚úÖ Verified by Wheelers</span>
  </div>

  <p>While awaiting verification, Wheelers browsing the <a href="{% url 'accessible_business_search' %}">Accessible Business Search</a> will see a <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">üìù Verification requested</span> badge next to your listing. This lets the community know you're actively seeking verification. Wheelers can click on the badge to view the verification request details and request to verify your accessibility features. We only allow verified Wheelers to complete the verification process.</p>
